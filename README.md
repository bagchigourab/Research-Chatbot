# Research-Chatbot
### ðŸš€ Objective
The Research-Chatbot is a powerful AI assistant built using a Large Language Model (LLM). It leverages LangChain, SQLite (SQLAlchemy) for data storage, Arxiv API for fetching research papers as a database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and GPT-4 as the core LLM.

### âœ¨ Key Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances chatbot responses with relevant research papers.
User Data Storage: Queries and interactions are stored in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.
Arxiv API Integration: Fetches relevant academic papers dynamically.
LLM-Powered Conversations: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent responses.
